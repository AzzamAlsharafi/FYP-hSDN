# Example of a configuration file for user-defined policies.
# This file will be auto-generated by the UI in the future.
# Empty lines, and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.

# Each line represents an individual policy.
# Policies are processed in order.

# Types of policies:
# - address: configure IPv4 address on interface
#       address [device] [interface id] [IPv4 address]
# - flow: defines a 'traffic flow', which is a combination of 5 values:
#       (src ip, dst ip, protocol, src port, dst port)
#       Each can have a set value or * wildcard.
#       flow [name] [src ip, dst ip, ...]
# - block: blocks traffic flow in device(s)
#       block [device/zone] [flow]
# - route: route traffic flow through interface on device
#       route [device] [flow] [exit interface id]
# - zone: add device to zone. 
#       Zones can be used instead of devices in 'block'
#       zone [device] [zone name]
# - disable: disable device interface 
#       (can disable all interfaces using 'all')
#       Disabled interfaces will be treated as non-existent
#       disable [device] [interface id]
